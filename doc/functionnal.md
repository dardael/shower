## Steps to Connect to the Admin Page

1. **Navigate to the Admin Page**
   - Open your browser and go to the `/admin` route of the application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/admin`).

2. **Sign In with Google**
   - If you are not signed in, you will be redirected to the Google login page.
   - Click the "Sign in with Google" button and select your Google account.

3. **Authorization Check**
   - After signing in, the application checks if your email matches authorized email.
   - If your email is authorized, you will be granted access to the admin page.
   - If your email is not authorized, you will see a "Not Authorized" message.

## Why the Admin Page is Protected

### 1. **Security**

The admin page allows users to manage sensitive configurations and settings of the application. Unauthorized access could compromise the integrity and functionality of the application.

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control**

Only specific users (e.g., administrators) should have the ability to modify critical aspects of the application. By restricting access to some the email, we ensure that only authorized personnel can access the admin page.

### 3. **Compliance**

Protecting the admin page ensures compliance with best practices for web application security, such as:

- Authentication: Verifying the identity of the user.
- Authorization: Ensuring the user has permission to access the page.

## Summary

The admin page is a critical part of the application and is protected to ensure that only authorized users can access it. By using Google OAuth for authentication and verifying the user's email for authorization, the application maintains a high level of security and adheres to best practices for web application.

description: Establish comprehensive API design standards ensuring consistency, performance, backward compatibility, and security across all REST API endpoints in Next.js applications.
globs: src/app/api/**/*.ts

---

Sub rule 1: API Structure and Organization
- Use RESTful conventions: GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal
- Organize endpoints by resource hierarchy: `/api/settings`, `/api/settings/theme-color`, `/api/settings/icon`
- Use descriptive endpoint names that clearly indicate the resource and operation
- Maintain consistent URL patterns across all API routes

Sub rule 2: Request and Response Formats
- Use consistent JSON request/response format across all endpoints
- Include success messages in responses for POST/PUT operations: `{ "message": "Operation successful" }`
- Use standard error format: `{ "error": "Error description" }`
- Include relevant data in responses: `{ "data": {}, "message": "Success" }`
- Use HTTP status codes appropriately: 200 for success, 400 for client errors, 401 for auth, 500 for server errors

Sub rule 4: Performance Optimization
- Use static imports instead of dynamic imports for security and performance
- Implement parallel data fetching with Promise.all for multiple related operations
- Use appropriate caching strategies: `cache: 'no-store'` for fresh data, default for cacheable data
- Minimize API calls by consolidating related data in single endpoints when appropriate
- Implement proper database connection management and query optimization

Sub rule 5: Error Handling and Validation
- Validate all input parameters with proper error messages
- Return specific error messages for validation failures: `"Invalid theme color provided"`
- Use try-catch blocks with comprehensive error logging
- Implement proper error boundaries and graceful degradation
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging and monitoring

Sub rule 6: Authentication and Security
- Apply authentication middleware consistently across protected endpoints
- Use the `withApi` wrapper for standardized authentication and logging
- Implement proper authorization checks for admin-only operations
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Use environment variables for configuration, never hardcoded secrets

Sub rule 8: Logging and Monitoring
- Use structured logging with the enhanced logging system
- Log API requests with method, URL, and user context: `logger.logApiRequest()`
- Log API responses with status code and duration: `logger.logApiResponse()`
- Include correlation IDs for request tracking

Sub rule 9: Testing and Quality Assurance
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all API endpoints
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies while testing business logic
- Use consistent test data and fixtures
- Validate response schemas and status codes

Sub rule 10: Type Safety and Validation
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all request/response types
- Define explicit types for API parameters and return values
- Use proper type guards for runtime validation
- Export types for client-side usage
- Maintain type consistency between frontend and backend

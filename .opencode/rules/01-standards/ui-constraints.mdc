description: Enforce UI development constraints to maintain simplicity, performance, and accessibility by prohibiting animations, transitions, device capability detection, and glass morphism effects across all React components.
globs: src/presentation/**/*.tsx
alwaysApply: false

Sub rule 1: Animation and Transition Restrictions
- Do not add CSS transitions or animations to any UI elements
- Avoid `transition` properties in styles or CSS classes
- Do not use `animation` properties or keyframes
- Skip hover animations, fade effects, and slide transitions
- Keep UI changes instantaneous without visual effects

Sub rule 2: Device Capability Detection
- Do not check battery level or battery status
- Avoid network connection detection or monitoring
- Do not implement device performance detection
- Skip slow device optimization logic
- Do not conditionally render based on device capabilities

Sub rule 3: Visual Effects Restrictions
- Do not implement glass morphism effects
- Avoid backdrop-filter, blur, or transparency effects
- Skip frosted glass or translucent panel designs
- Do not use complex visual filters or effects
- Keep visual design simple and direct

Sub rule 4: Performance Considerations
- Focus on static, immediate UI interactions
- Prioritize accessibility over visual effects
- Ensure fast rendering without animation delays
- Maintain consistent behavior across all devices
- Use simple state changes without transitions

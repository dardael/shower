Sub rule 1: Use Static Imports by Default
- Import all core modules, utilities, and domain entities using static imports at the top of files
- Use static imports for dependencies needed immediately when the module loads
- Prefer static imports for application logic, domain objects, and frequently used utilities
- Static imports should be the default choice unless there's a specific reason for dynamic import

Sub rule 2: When to Use Dynamic Imports
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting large libraries or components
- Use dynamic imports for conditional loading based on runtime conditions
- Use dynamic imports for optional dependencies that may not be available
- Use dynamic imports to resolve circular dependency issues
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical features that can load asynchronously

Sub rule 3: Static Import Patterns
- Group external library imports first, then internal module imports
- Use `import type` for type-only imports to improve tree-shaking
- Example: `import { SocialNetwork } from '@/domain/settings/entities/SocialNetwork'`

Sub rule 4: Dynamic Import Patterns
- Use `await import()` syntax for dynamic imports within functions
- Only use dynamic imports when there's a clear performance or architectural benefit
- Cache dynamically imported modules when appropriate to avoid repeated loading
- Example: `const { HeavyComponent } = await import('./HeavyComponent')`

Sub rule 5: Performance Considerations
- Static imports are bundled at build time and loaded synchronously
- Dynamic imports create separate bundles that load on-demand
- Consider the network cost of additional requests when using dynamic imports

Sub rule 6: Code Readability and Maintenance
- Static imports make dependencies explicit and easy to discover
- Dynamic imports can hide dependencies and make code harder to understand
- Use descriptive variable names for dynamically imported modules
- Document why a dynamic import is necessary when used

description: Establish comprehensive documentation standards for functional documentation, technical documentation, README.md, and AGENTS.md to ensure clear separation of concerns, developer onboarding, and maintainable project documentation.
globs: doc/**/*.{md}, README.md, AGENTS.md
alwaysApply: true
---

Sub rule 1: Functional Documentation (doc/functionnal.md)
- Write all functional documentation in `doc/functionnal.md`
- Use non-technical language accessible to non-developers
- Focus on user behavior, workflows, and business requirements
- Include step-by-step instructions for user interactions
- Document the "why" behind features, not just the "what"
- Use clear headings and bullet points for readability
- Update when user-facing features change

Sub rule 2: Technical Documentation (doc/technical.md)
- Write all technical documentation in `doc/technical.md`
- Do not include implementation details, and code examples
- Never include explicit file paths or links to existing files
- Document API endpoints, environment variables, and configuration
- Include troubleshooting guides and common issues
- Update when technical implementation changes
- Explain Architecture and design decisions

Sub rule 3: README.md Content Standards
- Include all developer setup information in README.md
- Document environment variables with examples and descriptions
- List all Docker and npm commands with clear descriptions
- Include architecture overview and project structure
- Add authentication setup instructions
- Provide testing guidelines and commands
- Include deployment instructions and considerations
- Update when project setup or commands change

Sub rule 4: AGENTS.md Content Standards
- Maintain current codebase file structure in AGENTS.md (only directories and important files)
- Update file structure whenever files are created, renamed, updated, or deleted
- Include all directories and important files with brief descriptions
- Use tree format for clear visualization of project structure
- Update when architectural changes occur
- Ensure structure reflects actual codebase state

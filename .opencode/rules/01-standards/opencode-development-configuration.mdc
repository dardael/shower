globs: opencode.json, .opencode/**/*
alwaysApply: true

Sub rule 1: Configuration File Treatment
- Treat `opencode.json` as core project configuration file
- Treat `.opencode/` directory as essential development infrastructure
- Never add `.opencode/` to `.gitignore` - these files must be version controlled
- Consider opencode configuration as part of the project's architecture and development infrastructure
- Maintain opencode files with same care as package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.

Sub rule 2: Directory Structure Standards
- `.opencode/agent/` - Contains AI agent definitions and capabilities
- `.opencode/rules/` - Contains coding rules and standards for the project
- `.opencode/command/` - Contains reusable command templates for common development tasks

Sub rule 3: Version Control and Collaboration
- Commit all opencode configuration changes with descriptive messages in a separate commit
- Review opencode changes in pull requests like any other code changes

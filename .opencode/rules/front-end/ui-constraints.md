- Avoid network connection detection or monitoring
- Do not implement device performance detection
- Skip slow device optimization logic
- Do not conditionally render based on device capabilities

Sub rule 3: Visual Effects Restrictions
- Do not implement glass morphism effects
- Avoid backdrop-filter, blur, or transparency effects
- Skip frosted glass or translucent panel designs
- Do not use complex visual filters or effects
- Keep visual design simple and direct

Sub rule 1: Test Simplicity
- Test only main behaviors
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Focus on what the code does, not how it does it
- Keep tests short and readable
- Keep assertions focused on the expected outcome

Sub rule 2: Test Structure
- Name test files as `ModuleName.test.ts`
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

Sub rule 3: Minimal Mocking
- Mock only external dependencies (API calls, database, file system)
- Never mock Chakra UI components or React components
- Use real implementations when possible
- Avoid mocking internal application logic

Sub rule 4: Test Isolation
- No shared state between tests
- Use `beforeEach` only for essential setup
- Avoid complex setup procedures
- Keep tests independent and fast

Sub rule 5: Console Output Suppression
- Ensure clean test output with no console warnings or errors visible in test results
- Mock all console methods that might be called during test execution

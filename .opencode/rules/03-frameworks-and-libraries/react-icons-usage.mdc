description: Enforce the use of React Icons library instead of inline SVG elements for consistent iconography, better maintainability, and optimized performance across React components.

Sub rule 1: Import React Icons
- Import icons from `react-icons` library instead of using inline SVG
- Use specific icon imports: `import { FcGoogle } from 'react-icons/fc'`
- Use icon sets: `fa` (Font Awesome), `fi` (Feather), `hi` (Heroicons), `io` (Ionicons), `bs` (Bootstrap), `fc` (Flat Color), etc.

Sub rule 2: Icon Implementation
- Use icon components directly: `<FcGoogle size={20} />`
- Apply size using `size` prop instead of width/height attributes
- Use `color` prop for icon coloring when needed
- Wrap icons in Chakra UI components for consistent spacing

Sub rule 3: Styling and Sizing
- Use Chakra UI `Box` or `Flex` for icon positioning and layout
- Apply consistent icon sizes: `size={16}`, `size={20}`, `size={24}`
- Use Chakra spacing utilities for icon spacing: `gap={2}`, `gap={3}`
- Apply color through Chakra theme: `color="fg.muted"` or via icon `color` prop

Sub rule 4: Performance Considerations
- React Icons are tree-shakable, only import used icons
- Icons are optimized SVG components bundled with the library
- Avoid creating custom icon components unless absolutely necessary
- Use consistent icon sets throughout the application for visual harmony

Sub rule 6: Accessibility
- Use `aria-label` on icon containers when icons convey meaning
- Ensure icons have sufficient color contrast for accessibility
- Use Chakra's built-in accessibility features with icon components
- Add descriptive text when icons are used as primary action indicators

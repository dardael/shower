# Goal

You must make logical git commits.

# Steps

IMPORTANT: if there are an error during the commit due to pre-commit hooks, make a summary of the error and stop to ask what to do next.

## Step 1: Identify Changes

- Look at current code changes made in the working directory.
- Identify logical groupings of changes that can be committed together.

## Step 2: Commit Changes

- Make git commits for each logical grouping of changes.
- The commit messages should be clear and descriptive of the changes made.

## Step 3: Validate Commits

- make a summary of the commits made. one bullet point per commit, with the commit hash, the commit message and the list of files changed in that commit.
- Write "All changes have been committed successfully." at the end of the summary.
